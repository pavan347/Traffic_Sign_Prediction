# traffic_sign_recognition
## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing traffic signs using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify various traffic signs from images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). It contains over 50,000 images of traffic signs belonging to 43 different classes.


## Model
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of over 95% on the test set. Below are some sample predictions:
